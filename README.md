# Restaurant Project

## Instructions
The minimum deliverables for my project are:
- Create and design a relational DB of your choice with minimum 5 tables
- Set Primary and Foreign Key constraints to create relations between the tables
- Write queries to select required sample data
- Use any type of the joins, create a view.
- Create a stored function that can be applied to a query in your DB
- Create a trigger and demonstrate how it runs
- Prepare an example query with a subquery to demonstrate how to extract data from your DB for analysis
- Build an ER diagram where all table relations are shown


## Datasets used
The five key datasets for my case study:
- <strong>customers</strong>: The customers table captures customers information, including their name, email, and who referred them to the restaurant.
- <strong>employees</strong>: The employees table maps the employee_id, name, salary, occupation, hire_date and who supervises them.
- <strong>transactions</strong>: The transactions table maps the transaction details such as type, amount and date of transaction.
- <strong>products</strong>: The products table displays the actual product_name and price of each menu item.
- <strong>suppliers</strong>: The suppliers table captures the restaurant's suppliers' information.
