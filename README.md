# Restaurant Project

## Introduction
A restaurant is in need of my assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business. The restaurant want me to perform analysis on their data to get insights that may help them to decide whether to expand the business or make changes.

## Datasets used
Five key datasets for this case study
- <strong>customers</strong>: The customers table captures customers information, including their name, email, and who referred them to the restaurant.
- <strong>employees</strong>: The employees table maps the employee_id, name, salary, occupation, hire_date and who supervises them.
- <strong>transactions</strong>: The transactions table maps the transaction details such as type, amount and date of transaction.
- <strong>products</strong>: The products table displays the actual product_name and price of each menu item.
- <strong>suppliers</strong>: The suppliers table captures the restaurant's suppliers' information.
